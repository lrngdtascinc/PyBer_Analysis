# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The idea behind this project was to gather and compare ride-sharing data like the average fares by city type, and per driver in said city type to compare the differences between each city type and come up with business recommemendations to help hash out and address certain disparities across the city types.

## Results
Looking at the pyber_summary dataframe created in the code, and the Total Fares by City Type multiple line chart:

We can clearly see that there is a significant difference in fares between all of the city types. This is problably attributed to the differences in population size, and population density, considering cities have a larger number of people cramped together in a smaller area as compared to, the smaller more wide spread populations of rural areas. The distance of desired locations is also a likely reason why the average fare per ride differs the way it does, since rural areas are more spread out, and desired locations are sparce, drivers probably have to ride further distances, compared to rides in urban areas, where everything in more conveniently packed together.   
## Summary
