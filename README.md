# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The idea behind this project was to gather and compare ride-sharing data like the average fares by city type, and per driver in said city type to compare the differences between each city type and come up with business recommemendations to help hash out and address disparities across the city types.

## Results
Looking at the Total Fares by City Type multiple line chart

We can clearly see that there is a significant difference in fares between all of the city types. This is problably attributed to the differences in population size, driver count, and population density, considering cities have a larger number of people, and a larger number of drivers cramped together in a smaller area as compared to, the smaller more wide spread populations of rural areas with less drivers available. The distance of desired locations is also a likely reason why the average fare per ride differs the way it does, since rural areas are more spread out, and desired locations are sparce, drivers probably have to ride further distances, compared to rides in urban areas, where everything in more conveniently packed together.  
## Summary
(Provide three business recomendations based on the results)
In order to help the business hash out and try to make the differences between the city types not so large, I have come up with three different solutions that can help change the numbers individually or in combination with each other. My first recommendation would be to try to expand and advertise to more rural areas in an attempt to increase the number of drivers in rural areas, effectively providing more ride oppurtunities to rural communities, which in turn would rack up more revenue for the company, which would allow the average price of a ride in rural areas to drop to a more reasonable price, effectively incentivizing both riders and drivers by providing more supply at a cheaper rate, and more work oppurtunities for the people in rural communities. My next recommendation will focus solely on Suburban communities. Since Suburban communities have less people compared to urban areas, but a much higher population density comapred to rural areas I think introducing a carpooling option would be a great way to extend the length of rides overall which would allow the company to charge a slightly higher price for a more convenient
